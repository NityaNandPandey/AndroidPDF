    <!-- The following attributes are designed to be used as values to the style attribute
     of a Toolbar or LinearLayout in a fragment's layout.

     Depending on whether an app bar is used in the fragment, either @style/ThemeOverlay.Fragment or
     @style/ThemeOverlay.Fragment.NoAppBar should be used on the Fragment root element's android:theme
     attribute. The correct toolbar and app bar styles will be selected by the theme.

     NOTE: The fragment{AppBar,Toolbar}Style attributes may not be set from the root element's
     theme if the attributes are referenced in a <included>-layout. On API 21+, the expected
     scoped-theme (in the layout xml) is applied to the included layout, but for APIs < 21 the
     theme seen by the included layout is the same as the parent layout root element's theme prior
     to the android:theme attribute being applied.
     In order for the toolbar and app bar themes to be selected correctly for all API versions,
     <included>-layouts should be avoided for the toolbar and app bar themselves. -->
